# There-Far-Away

There Far Away is a  WPF application tailored for a domestic travel agency in Serbia. This application adopts the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern and incorporates Material Design principles for a modern and user-friendly interface. Specifically designed for a 41-year-old woman with basic domain knowledge and computer proficiency, the app caters to her need for speed, efficiency, and automation, even in a distracted and time-limited work environment.

To optimize usability on small-screen Netbook-like displays with a resolution of 750x430 and 96dpi, There Far Away is thoughtfully adapted for compact screens. The app's responsive design ensures seamless interactions and easy navigation, providing an exceptional user experience.

Two distinct user roles are supported: Users and Agents. Agents, with administrative privileges, can effortlessly manage journeys and attractions. They can add, edit, and delete journeys and attractions, as well as combine multiple attractions into comprehensive packages. Additionally, Agents have access to various reports, facilitating data analysis and decision-making.

On the other hand, Users can register, explore available journeys and attractions, and proceed to purchase or reserve their preferred trips. The app streamlines these processes, incorporating shortcuts and automation to minimize user effort and maximize efficiency.

#Features
## Journeys
### Preview
Within the There Far Away WPF application, Agents are equipped with a fast and efficient preview of all touristic journeys through a visually appealing card-based interface. Each journey is presented as a compact card displaying its name and the start and end dates, allowing Agents to quickly scan and identify relevant details at a glance.

This card-based view is thoughtfully designed for the small-screen Netbook-like displays, ensuring that Agents can seamlessly navigate through multiple journeys without feeling overwhelmed by excessive information.

For a more comprehensive understanding of a specific journey, Agents can easily access detailed information with a single click. A dedicated "Detailed View" button is provided on each journey card, enabling Agents to delve deeper into the journey's itinerary, activities, pricing, and other essential aspects.

### Create Journey
The Agent feature for adding journeys in the There Far Away WPF application offers a streamlined and user-friendly process through a well-organized three-step Stepper. This design caters to the Agent's work environment, characterized by distractions, limited time, and the need for efficiency.

Step 1: Journey Information
On the first page of the Stepper, the Agent inputs essential journey details, such as the journey name, start and end dates, price, type of transport, and an eye-catching cover image. To ensure data accuracy, the Agent cannot proceed to the next page until all inputs are validated, preventing any potential errors due to the distracted nature of their work environment.

Step 2: Journey Location Selection
The second page features a map view, where the Agent can specify the journey's start and end locations. Two inputs are available for the Agent to manually type addresses, and upon pressing Enter, they receive real-time feedback and suggestions. Alternatively, Agents can use an interactive icon next to the input to place a pin on the map, simplifying the selection process. This intuitive approach minimizes data entry errors and enhances the user experience.

Step 3: Attractions Selection
The third page of the Stepper offers two searchable lists. The first list comprises all available attractions, and the second consists of selected attractions for the journey. Agents can effortlessly add attractions by utilizing a drag-and-drop mechanism between the lists. Additionally, the map of Serbia displays pins for the selected attractions, providing a visual representation of their locations. This feature aids the Agent in crafting engaging and diverse journey itineraries while maintaining a clear overview.
