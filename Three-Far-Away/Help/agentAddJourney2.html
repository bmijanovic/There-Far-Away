    <h1>Add journey</h1>
    <p>
        This is the second of three pages for adding/editing journeys that the agent sees after clicking the 'Add Journey' ('Edit Journey') button on their home page. The 'Add Journeys Start & End Location' page has the following layout:
    </p>
    <div>
        <img src="../Assets/addJourney2.png" width="100%" />
    </div>
    <ol>
        <li>Input fields for entering start & end address</li>
        <li>Buttons that enable dropping start/end location on map</li>
        <li>Map</li>
        <li>Back to previous page</li>
        <li>Button For Next Step In Proccess Of Creating Journey</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Input Fields For Start/End Location Address</h3>
    <p>In the Create Journey window, you will find an address input field that allows you to enter a specific address for the journey. The address input field provides functionality to search for and display the location on a map based on the entered address. Here's how it works:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Typing the Address: When entering an address, follow the guidelines provided for formatting the address correctly. The recommended format is [Street] [House Number], [City], [Country]. For example, "Main Street 123, Belgrade, Serbia".</li>
        <li>Auto-Correction and Location Search: As you type the address and press Enter, the system will attempt to search for the corresponding location based on the entered address. If a valid address is found, it will be autocorrected and the location will be displayed on the map with a pin.</li>
        <li>Autocorrection: If the entered address contains minor spelling mistakes or discrepancies, the system will attempt to autocorrect it to the closest matching address. This helps ensure accurate location information for the journey.</li>
        <li>Displaying the Location: Upon successful location search and autocorrection, the map will display the address with a pin indicating the exact location. This visual representation helps provide a clear reference point for the journey.</li>
        <li>Error Messages: If the entered address cannot be found or there are issues with the search process, an error message will be displayed. In such cases, double-check the entered address for any errors or try entering a more specific address.</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <h3>Buttons for enabling pin drop on map</h3>
    <p>In the Create Journey window, you will find two buttons that allow you to enable the pin drop functionality on the map. These buttons provide a convenient way to drop a pin at a specific location on the map, indicating start/end point for the journey. Here's how they work:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Right-Click Pin Drop Button: The right-click pin drop button allows you to drop a pin on the map by right-clicking on the desired location.</li>
        <li>Enabling Pin Drop: To enable pin drop on the map, click the left-click. Once enabled, the map will respond to your clicks, allowing you to drop pins at specific locations.</li>
    </ul>

    <br />
    <h3>Map</h3>
    <p>
        In the Create Journey window, you will find an interactive map that allows you to navigate and explore different locations. The map provides various functionalities to help you visualize the journey and its destinations. Here's how you can interact with the map:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Drag to Move: To move your view across the map, click and hold on any part of the map, then drag it in the desired direction. This allows you to explore different areas and navigate to specific regions of interest.</li>
        <li>Scroll Wheel to Zoom: You can use the scroll wheel on your mouse (or trackpad) to zoom in or zoom out on the map. Scroll forward to zoom in, making the map display more detailed information. Scroll backward to zoom out, providing a broader view of the map.</li>
        <li>Double-Click to Zoom In: Double-clicking on the map allows you to quickly zoom in on a specific location. This feature is useful when you want to explore a particular area in more detail.</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <h3>Previous Page</h3>
    <p>The Previous button in the stepper allows you to navigate back to the previous step or page within the journey creation process. This button provides flexibility for making changes or reviewing details from the previous page without losing your progress</p>
    <br />
    <h3>Proceed to next page</h3>
    <p>In the Create Journey window, you will find a "Next" button that allows you to proceed to the next step in creating a journey. The "Next" button is an important control that helps ensure all required information is filled in correctly before advancing.</p>
