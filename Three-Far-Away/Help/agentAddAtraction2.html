        <li>Auto-Correction and Location Search: As you type the address and press Enter, the system will attempt to search for the corresponding location based on the entered address. If a valid address is found, it will be autocorrected and the location will be displayed on the map with a pin.</li>
        <li>Autocorrection: If the entered address contains minor spelling mistakes or discrepancies, the system will attempt to autocorrect it to the closest matching address. This helps ensure accurate location information for the attraction.</li>
        <li>Displaying the Location: Upon successful location search and autocorrection, the map will display the address with a pin indicating the exact location. This visual representation helps provide a clear reference point for the attraction.</li>
        <li>Error Messages: If the entered address cannot be found or there are issues with the search process, an error message will be displayed. In such cases, double-check the entered address for any errors or try entering a more specific address.</li>
    </ul>
