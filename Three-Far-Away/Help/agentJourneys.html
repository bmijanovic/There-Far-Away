        <p>
            This is the first page that the agent sees after logging in.
            The journeys preview page has the following layout:
        </p>

        <div>
            <img src="../Assets/agentsJourneys.png" width="100%" />
        </div>
        <ol>
            <li>Button for opening the hamburger menu</li>
            <li>Button for attractions</li>
            <li>Button for reports</li>
            <li>Button for navigating to the login page</li>
            <li>Card with basic information of one journey</li>
            <li>Button for fast operations with journey</li>
            <li>Edit button</li>
            <li>Delete button</li>
            <li>Button for detailed preview of the selected journey</li>
            <li>Button for previewing the next page</li>
            <li>Button for creating new attraction</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            When you log in to the system, you arrive at this screen. Here, the first 4 most recent journeys in our assortment are listed. 
            Each card presents one journey and contains basic information such as the journey's name, departure and arrival dates, and price. 
            To view more detailed information and edit, delete or see passengers, you click the button labeled "View". 
            If there are more than 4 journeys available, you will also see a "Next" button on the screen, which fetches the next 4 journeys.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the side, there is a menu that allows you to switch to your journeys or log out of the system.
        </p>
        <p>
            As an agent, on the homepage, you have quick shortcuts for editing and deleting individual journeys. 
            You can access them by clicking on the button marked with three dots.
            Additionally, in the top right corner, there is a button that takes you to the process of creating a new journey.
        </p>
